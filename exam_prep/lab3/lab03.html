        This assignment requires you to write JavaScript code fulfilling a
        number of common functions. It consists of 2 parts. It is not allowed to
        modify this HTML file. Put all your code into app.js.

        <h2>Part I - CAPTCHA</h2>
        <p>
          Randomly generate two numbers between 1 and 10 (including both) and
          one of the three mathematical operators plus (+), minus (-) and
          multiply (*). The user is asked to calculate the result of the
          mathematical operation (number 1 operator number 2), where number 1 is
          the larger of the two generated numbers. This is done by displaying
          "Calculate " followed by the operation in the label with id
          <mark>taskMsg</mark>. When the user enters the result into the text
          field with id <mark>mathIn</mark> and presses the check button below,
          check whether the result is correct and display "correct" or
          "incorrect" (depending on the outcome) in the div with id
          <mark>resultMsg</mark>. In the correct case, the class of the div
          shall be changed to "alert alert-success" and the display style to
          block. In the incorrect case, the class of the div shall be changed to
          "alert alert-danger" and the display style to block. Approx. 5 seconds
          after the result has been displayed, a new operation shall be
          calculated and displayed (as described above), the
          <mark>resultMsg</mark> div shall disappear again, and the input field
          emptied.

        <h2>Part II - Asynchronicity</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever the button below is pressed, the following shall happen: The
          numbers from 1 (including) to the number entered in field with id
          <mark>loopNumber</mark> (including) shall be printed into the div with
          id <mark>loopOutput</mark>. A new line (br tag) shall separate each
          number, but no new line shall be inserted before 1 or after the final
          number. Each output shall have a timeout of 10 milliseconds (Note:
          This will not cause any noticeable delay in the behaviour, which is
          fine!). Whenever the button is pressed again, the output div is
          emptied first. Do not use ES6 (or higher) constructs. You can assume
          that the entered number is a valid integer.
