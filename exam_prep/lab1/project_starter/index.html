    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO HTTP</h1>
    <h2>1. About this chapter</h2>
    <p>
      This short chapter will introduce the basics of the HTTP protocol,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the message syntax,</li>
      <li>request methods (verbs),</li>
      <li>and response status codes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Substantial parts are taken from
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230" target="_blank">RFC 7230</a>
      and
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231" target="_blank">RFC 7231</a>
    </p>
    <h2>2. HTTP Message Syntax</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Message Format</h3>
    <p>
      All HTTP/1.1 messages consist of a start-line followed by a sequence of
      octets in a format similar to the Internet Message Format: zero or more
      header fields (collectively referred to as the <strong>headers</strong> or
      the <strong>header section</strong>), an empty line indicating the end of
      the header section, and an optional message body.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Start Line</h3>
    <p>
      An HTTP message can be either a <strong>request</strong> from client to
      server or a <strong>response</strong> from server to client.
      Syntactically, the two types of message differ only in the start-line,
      which is either a request-line (for requests) or a status-line (for
      responses), and in the algorithm for determining the length of the message
      body.
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.1 Request Line</h4>
    <p>
      A request-line begins with a method token, followed by a single space
      (SP), the request-target, another single space (SP), the protocol version,
      and ends with CRLF. The method token indicates the request method to be
      performed on the target resource. The request method is case-sensitive.
      The request methods defined by this specification can be found in
      <a href="#S3">Section 3</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.2 Status line</h4>
    <p>
      The first line of a response message is the status-line, consisting of the
      protocol version, a space (SP), the status code, another space, a possibly
      empty textual phrase describing the status code, and ending with CRLF.
    </p>
    <p>
      The status-code element is a 3-digit integer code describing the result of
      the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's corresponding
      request. The rest of the response message is to be interpreted in light of
      the semantics defined for that status code. See
      <a href="#S4">Section 4</a> for information about the semantics of status
      codes, including the classes of a status code (indicated by the first
      digit).
    </p>
    <h2 id="S3">3. Request Methods</h2>
    <p>
      The request method token is the primary source of request semantics; it
      indicates the purpose for which the client has made this request and what
      is expected by the client as a successful result.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification defines a number of standardized methods that are
      commonly used in HTTP, as outlined by the following table. By convention,
      standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase US-ASCII letters.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>GET</strong></td>
        <td>Transfer a current representation of the target resource.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>POST</strong></td>
        <td>Perform resource-specific processing on the request payload.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>PUT</strong></td>
        <td>
          Replace all current representations of the target resource with the
          request payload.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>DELETE</strong></td>
        <td>Remove all current representations of the | target resource.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2 id="S4">4. Response Status Codes</h2>
    <p>
      The status-code element is a three-digit integer code giving the result of
      the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP clients are not required to
      understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
      understanding is obviously desirable. However, a client MUST understand
      the class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat
      an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of
      that class, with the exception that a recipient MUST NOT cache a response
      with an unrecognized status code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first digit of the status-code defines the class of response. The last
      two digits do not have any categorization role. There are five values for
      the first digit:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process</li>
      <li>
        2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and
        accepted
      </li>
      <li>
        3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete
        the request
      </li>
      <li>
        4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
        fulfilled
      </li>
      <li>
        5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid
        request
      </li>
    </ol>
  </body>
